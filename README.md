# js_projects
This is a repository of small projects used to learn and get better at programming in javascript.

In order to run any of these projects do the following (only tested on MAC):

1. clone the repository
2. install node (`brew install node`)
  * both node and npm should be installed following this (check using `node -v` and `npm -v`)
3. Navigate to the folder which includes the main .html (usually named `index.html`), .css (usually named `style.css`), .js files you want to see.
4. Run a python http server (`python -m http.server`)
5. Open your web browser and navigate to the newly generated http server (usually named `http://0.0.0.0:8000/`).
6. Enjoy the project in all it's glory XD
